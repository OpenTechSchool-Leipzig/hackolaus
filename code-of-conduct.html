        <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
        <h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

        <p>
          A primary goal of all the conferences and user groups that refer to
          this Code of Conduct is to be inclusive to the largest number of
          contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible.
          As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming
          environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation,
          ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and religion (or lack
          thereof).
        </p>

        <p>
          This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who
          participate in our community, as well as the consequences for
          unacceptable behavior.
        </p>

        <p>
          We invite all those who participate in our events to help us create
          safe and positive experiences for everyone.
        </p>

        <h2 id="open-sourceculturetech-citizenship">
          Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship
        </h2>

        <p>
          A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open
          [source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging participants to
          recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and
          their effects on our community.
        </p>

        <p>
          Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive
          action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and
          abuses of power that exist in society.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our
          community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to
          contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.
        </p>

          Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
        </h2>

        <p>
          Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors
          and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.
          Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply
          immediately.
        </p>

        <p>
          If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community
          organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and

          without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

          possible. You can find a list of organizers to contact for each of the
          supporters of this code of conduct at the bottom of this page.
          Additionally, community organizers are available to help community
          members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those
          experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of
          in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by
          the person experiencing distress.
        </p>

        <h2 id="addressing-grievances">Addressing Grievances</h2>

        <p>

          with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be
          handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.
