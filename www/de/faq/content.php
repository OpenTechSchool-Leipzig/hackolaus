        <h3>Will the venue be open overnight?</h3>

        <h3>I can’t stay the whole time, can I still participate?</h3>
        <p>Of course! We realize that a weekend is a long time and people may
            need to attend to other commitments. We do, however, strongly
            encourage you to be present on Friday to see the NGOs pitch ideas and
            find a team.</p>

        <h3>What if I don't know how to code?</h3>
        <p>You are still welcome! We have several challenges that don’t require
            any coding skills. As long as you come willing to learn and contribute
            ideas.</p>
