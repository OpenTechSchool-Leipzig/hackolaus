        We are a community of volunteers, people passionate about design and code, from the Leipzig area, 
        who are eager to use their skills in the realms of digital, creative, and technology for a good cause.
    </p>
    <p>
        We warmly invite you to participate in our annual 3rd Hackolaus weekend from December 8th to 10th, 2023, 
        or better yet, to bring your problem to the event. We are happy to help.
    </p>
    <h2>How is this going to work?</h2>
    <p>
        During a hackathon, hacking goes on non-stop - that is, tinkering, brainstorming, designing, and programming. Because that is our passion.
        However, we would like to combine this passion with something useful and work on topics that create added value for others (e.g., you), so that we may help solve a small problem for your passion... A balance between giving and receiving for all of us, so to speak.
        And since you always give a lot, you should be allowed to take this weekend. Of course, at no cost!
    </p>
    <h2>Who solves the problem?</h2>
    <p>
        At the beginning of a hackathon, all ideas/wishes/problems are pitched, which means the problem is presented to all participants, and the context is explained.
        Afterwards, volunteers can come together who are interested in working on that specific problem, and then we get started!
    </p>
    <h2>How to take part?</h2>
    <p>
        Your part would be to apply to us with your problem using <a href="https://form.typeform.com/to/Ds9m6LyI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the form linked here</a>.
        If you're in, you'll present your challenge during the Hackolaus weekend, and we can get started. 
        By the way, this is a great opportunity to introduce your association/project work to a wider audience and 
        potentially receive support in other ways as well!

                Abstinence is not everything, but without abstinence everything is nothing. According to the mission
                statement
                of the Institut f√ºr Gesundheit und Bildung e.V., it is our task to encourage
                and enable addicted people to lead an abstinent life.
                <span class="read-more-text hidden"> An abstinent life is seen as the best possibility for addicts to
                    lead a
                    satisfied, independent and self-determined life. Adaptation treatment is part of the services for
                    medical
                    rehabilitation of addicts and represents phase II of withdrawal treatment. Adaptation is also to be
                    understood as an opportunity to review and possibly modify one's therapy experiences in everyday
                    life.
                    During the treatment period, patients should be supported in building up favorable conditions for an
                    abstinent life. In addition to the therapeutic offers, comprehensive support in all practical life
                    and
                    social work issues is part of our work focus. The main topics are: testing the ability to abstain
                    under
                    real
                    conditions, clarification of the professional situation, development of social skills, development
                    of
                    future
                    perspectives, life planning, organization of free time, organization of social relationships,
                    management
                    of
