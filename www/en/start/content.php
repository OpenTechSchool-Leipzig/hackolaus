        <p>
            Many NGOs, associations and individuals work hard to give to social, environmental or other
            sustainability causes. We believe that they should not only give but also receive, that society should
            give back to them.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is why we are collaborating on a hackathon to support these organizations with digial and creative solutions to help
            them focus more on delivering impact.
